Passion for <em>Tech</em> gained momemuntum at High School level having taken Computer Studies as a selected subject, and performing well in it in the KCSE exams.<br><br>After my Fourth year of study at the University, I opted to enroll as a Teacher in one of the Secondary Schools back at my Home Place but it did not take long before an opportunity to join <strong>Moringa School</strong> came knocking and I applied for a Software Engineering Course as a <em>Hybrid</em> Student. My vision is to come out of Moringa as a Full Stack Web Developer - fully equiped and ready to fit into the Job Market.<br><br>Kevin Wanjala hails from the broader Western Region, Trans Nzoia County, precisely Kitale.</p>

                <h2>Spirit Animal</h2>
                <p>My Spirit animal is the Lion. It is often associated with courage, strength, and leadership. Its majestic presence symbolizes power and confidence, inspiring many to embrace their inner strength and leadership qualities. The lionâ€™s representation extends beyond its physical attributes to embody qualities like bravery, resilience, and loyalty. Its social structure within prides showcases cooperation and familial bonds, reflecting the importance of community and support networks. As a symbol, the lion encourages individuals to embrace their inner courage, stand tall in adversity, and lead with integrity.</p>
