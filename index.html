                <h2>Spirit Animal</h2>
                <p>My Spirit animal is the Lion. It is often associated with courage, strength, and leadership. Its majestic presence symbolizes power and confidence, inspiring many to embrace their inner strength and leadership qualities. The lionâ€™s representation extends beyond its physical attributes to embody qualities like bravery, resilience, and loyalty. Its social structure within prides showcases cooperation and familial bonds, reflecting the importance of community and support networks. As a symbol, the lion encourages individuals to embrace their inner courage, stand tall in adversity, and lead with integrity.</p>
